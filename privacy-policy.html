                            <h2>5. HOW WE STORE, PROCESS AND TRANSFER YOUR CUSTOMERS PERSONAL DATA</h2>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30"><b>General.</b> The Company is based the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. Please be advised that U.S. law and laws of other countries may not offer the same protections as the law of your jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30">We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”), the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>a.  Complaints and Dispute Resolution.</b> In compliance with the Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your/or your customers personal information.  Inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at privacy@Blinkai.com or mailing address:<br />
                                Blink AI, Inc.<br />
                                5110-A Lancaster CT<br />
                                Austin, TX 78743<br />
                                 We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit the following link for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.</li>
                                <li><b>b.   Arbitration.</b> You may also be able to invoke binding arbitration for unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from JAMS; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident. The arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual’s same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties.</li>
                                <li><b>c.  U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement.</b> Our Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30"><b>Data security.</b> We use reasonable and appropriate information security safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Blink AI cannot ensure the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Service or an absolute guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Please understand that there is no ideal technology or measure to maintain 100 % security. Among others, we utilize the following information security measures:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pseudominization of certain categories of your customer’s Personal Data;</li>
                                <li>Encryption of your customer’s Personal Data in transit and in rest;</li>
                                <li>Systematic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing;</li>
                                <li>Organizational and legal measures. For example, our employees have different levels of access to your customer’s Personal Data and only those in charge of data management get access to your customer’s Personal Data and only for limited purposes required for the operation of the Service. We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your customer’s Personal Data.</li>
                                <li>Conducting periodical data protection impact assessments in order to ensure that the Service fully adheres to the principles of ‘privacy by design’, ‘privacy by default’ and others. We also commit to undertake privacy audit in case of Company’s merger or takeover.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30">Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Blink AI, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the services you connect to Plivo, Twilio, Facebook or Google Calendar make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30"><b>Data retention.</b> We will retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active or needed to provide you services, and only for as long as it serves purposes of processing identified in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. At any time, you can remove your customer’s Personal Data by instructing us to remove it by emailing us at privacy@Blinkai.com.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30">You should be aware that we may retain certain Personal Data and other information after your account has been terminated in an aggregated, anonymized form unless you provide a written email to us at privacy@Blinkai.com. Any posts or comments your customer made on Facebook or Google calendar may remain visible if and after you delete your account. We are not obligated to remove their post, messages, or comments. We will also retain your Personal Data as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30">All information that you provide to us through the web is automatically uploaded to our servers and is stored there in duplicate to the information stored on your customers browser.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30">If you remove data from your account, you will no longer see it in the service, but some backups of the data may remain in our archive servers for a reasonable period of time due to technical reasons.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30"><b>Third party (onward) transfers and Privacy Shield compliance.</b> In the context of an onward transfer, we have responsibility for the processing of Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We remain liable under the Principles and GDPR, if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles and GDPR, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For any onward transfer we commit to execute a formal agreement with any receiving party or processor acting on our behalf.
                            If we receive Personal Data subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                            <p class="f_300 mb-30"><b>Contacting you.</b> You agree that we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices, updates to the Privacy Policy). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails, unless applicable laws provide differently for particular types of users.</p>
